Question 1
-----------
> Consider three Web pages with the following links:

> ![title](/home/blur-exlin-002/Desktop/DesktopQ3/prueba/Interes/graph1.png)

> Suppose we compute PageRank with a β of 0.7, and we introduce the additional constraint
that the sum of the PageRanks of the three pages must be 3, to handle the problem that
otherwise any multiple of a solution will also be a solution. Compute the PageRanks a, b,
and c of the three pages A, B, and C, respectively. Then, identify from the list below, the true
statement.

We are going to create the equation of pageRank:


$r = \beta M r +[\frac{(1 - \beta)}{N}]_{N}$  ,

where $[\frac{(1 - \beta)}{N}]_{N}$ is a vector with all $N$ entries $(1-\beta )/{N}$

In each iteration, we need to:

- Compute $r^{new} = \beta M r^{old}$
- Add a contstant value $(1-\beta )/{N}$ to each entry in $r^{new}$

We will call $t$ (teleport link) to the vector  $[\frac{(1-\beta)}{N}]_{N}$  

So the equation is equal to 

$r = \beta M r +t$  ,


Let's start define the parameters

$\beta=0.7$

```{r}
beta <- 0.7
```

Number of nodes is equal to  3

$n = 3$ 

```{r}
n <- 3
```

The teleport link
```{r}
# jumping to a random page/teleportation (i.e., 1 - B)
t <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = 1, rep((1-beta)/n,n))
```


The matrix 
$M=\left(\begin{array}{lcr}0 & 0 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\ \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 1\end{array}\right)$

```{r}
M <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 3)
M
```

```{r}
# rank vector (i.e., initialize page rank)
r <- matrix(c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3), ncol = 1)
r 
```

```{r}
# PageRank: Power Iteration (i.e., iterate until r does not change)
r <- beta * M %*% r + t
r
r <- beta * M %*% r + t
r
r <- beta * M %*% r + t
r
r <- beta * M %*% r + t
r
```

r hasn't changed in the last iteration



- a + b = 0.655 FALSE
```{r}
# a + b
(r[1] + r[2]) * 3 
```
- a + c = 2.035 FALSE
```{r}
# a + c
(r[1] + r[3]) * 3 
```

- a + c = 2.595 TRUE
```{r}
# a + C
(r[1] + r[3]) * 3 
```
- b + c = 2.5 FALSE
```{r}
# b + c
(r[2] + r[3]) * 3 
```


Question 2
----------

> Consider three Web pages with the following links:

> ![title](/home/blur-exlin-002/Desktop/DesktopQ3/prueba/Interes/CourseMiningMassiveDatasets/Assigment/week1/solution/graph2.png)

> Suppose we compute PageRank with β=0.85. Write the equations for the PageRanks a, b,
and c of the three pages A, B, and C, respectively. Then, identify in the list below, one of the
equations.

> - a + c = 2.035 
> - a + c = 2.595 
> - b + c = 2.5 

Let's start define the parameters


$\beta=0.85$

```{r}
beta <- 0.85
```

Number of nodes is equal to  3

$n = 3$ 

```{r}
n <- 3
```

The teleport link
```{r}
# jumping to a random page/teleportation (i.e., 1 - B)
t <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = 1, rep((1-beta)/n,n))
```


The matrix 
$M=\left(\begin{array}{lcr}0 & 0 & 1 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\ \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 0\end{array}\right)$

```{r}
M <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 3)
M
```

```{r}
# rank vector (i.e., initialize page rank)
r <- matrix(c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3), ncol = 1)
r 
```


```{r}
# PageRank: Power Iteration (i.e., iterate until r does not change)

for (i in 1:30) {
    r <- beta * M %*% r + t
}
r
r <- beta * M %*% r + t
r

```

Afer  30 iterations converge


```{r}
# rank vector (i.e., initialize page rank)
if(round(r[1],5) == round((r[2]+0.15),5)) {
    print('a = c + .15b')
}else{
    print('a != c + .15b')
}
if(round(r[1],5)==round(0.9*r[3] + 0.05 * r[2],5)) {
    print('a = .9c + .05b')
}else{
    print('a != .9c + .05b')
}

if(round(0.95*r[2],5)== round(0.475 * r[1] + 0.05* r[3],5)) {
    print('.95b = .475a + .05c')
}else{
    print('.95b != .475a + .05c')
}

if(round(0.85*r[1],5) == round( r[3]+0.15* r[2],5)) {
    print('.85a = c + .15b')
}else{
    print('.85a != c + .15b')
}

```

Question 3
----------
> Consider three Web pages with the following links:
> ![title](/home/blur-exlin-002/Desktop/DesktopQ3/prueba/Interes/CourseMiningMassiveDatasets/Assigment/week1/solution/graph2.png)

> Assuming no "taxation," compute the PageRanks a, b, and c of the three pages A, B, and C,
using iteration, starting with the "0th" iteration where all three pages have rank a = b = c = 1.

> Compute as far as the 5th iteration, and also determine what the PageRanks are in the limit.
Then, identify the true statement from the list below.

> - After iteration 5, a = 21/16
> - After iteration 5, b = 5/8
> - After iteration 5, b = 1/2
> - After iteration 5, b = 9/16

Let's start define the parameters



The matrix 
$M=\left(\begin{array}{lcr}0 & 0 & 1 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\ \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 0\end{array}\right)$

```{r}
M <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 3)
M
```

```{r}
# rank vector (i.e., initialize page rank)
r <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1), ncol = 1)
```

```{r}
# rank vector (i.e., initialize page rank)
r <- M %*% r
r
for (i in 1:5) {
    r <-  M %*% r
}
r
```

```{r}
option_1_a<-21/16
option_2_b<-5/8
option_3_b<-1/2
option_4_b<-9/16

option_1_a
option_2_b
option_3_b

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
